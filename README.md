# Naive Bayes Workbook
This is an exercise to walk through the Naive Bayes algorithm. You will be walked through the basics of Bayes Theorem under the assumption you have no prior knowledge. We will then introduce you to Naive Bayes as a machine learning algorithm. <br><br>

You will be asked to implement the algorithm from scratch. Please avoid the use of scikit-learn or other machine learning libraries for the implementation of naive bayes - pandas, numpy, or similar libraries are what we expect to see for your Python implementation. It is acceptable to use scikit-learn libraries (or other libraries) for evaluating your algorithm's correctness.<br>

Your notebook will be evaluated on the following:
<ul>
    <li>Correctness</li>
    <li>Legibility</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<br>

Please fork this repo and use the notebook within. When you have completed your notebook, present your submission by sharing your repo with us and sending us an email with a direct link. It is important that you demonstrate your ability to use GitHub as well as to complete the notebook assignment.<br>

If you do not already have <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/install/">Anaconda Navigator</a> installed, you will need to do so. You can opt for a different setup of your python environment, but Anaconda is recommended for beginners. Anaconda comes by default with JupyterLab and JupyterNotebook both of which will allow you to open and edit the Python notebook. Anaconda includes a basic enviroment with the most used Python data science packages, but you may install additional packages to complete this excercise. You can search <a href="https://anaconda.org/">https://anaconda.org</a> for terminal commands to install more packages or use the Anaconda GUI.<br>


**While important, this assignment is not the sole candidate selection criteria.**  Please do not be discouraged if you are having difficulties understanding or implementing the assignment.  We are here to assist you with questions or concerns that come up while trying to complete it.
